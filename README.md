# KeyHolder
Android application for password management

## Overall outline
KeyHolder is an intuitive application for storing your logins and passwords securely on the mobile device. With it, you can forget about seeking a compromise between power of a key and its ease of remembering - KeyHolder can generate a sequence, strong enough so you can save it and use in the future - without any memoization effort. Moreover, you can export encrypted bundle of keys and import it on another device. Simple, safe and helpful.

## Requirements
Application is designed for Android 6.0 (API 23).

## Implementation details
KeyHolder was implemented in Java (v.8). Many different Google's APIs were used (as SmartLock, Android Store) - many of them may misbehave with other Android versions.
