# KeyHolder
Android application for password management

## Overall outline

Moreover, you can export encrypted bundle of keys and import it on another device. Simple, safe and helpful.

## Requirements

## Implementation details
KeyHolder was implemented in Java (v.8). Many different Google's APIs were used (as SmartLock, Android Store) - many of them may misbehave with other Android versions.
